#Preside Editor

This project is dedicated to the richeditor used in Preside. It is 99% simply a specifically configured instance of [CKEditor](http://ckeditor.com/). The rest of the 1% is made up of Preside specific plugins for the editor.

If you find yourself here, you're either a Preside contributer wanting to make changes to the editor, or you're in the wrong place and probably want to be at the [main Preside repository](https://github.com/pixl8/Preside-CMS).
