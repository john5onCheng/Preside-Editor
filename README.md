#Preside Editor

This project is dedicated to storing and tracking the base configuration of the editor used by Preside, [CKEditor](http://ckeditor.com/).

All Preside custom extensions to the editor such as the Widgets plugin, are tracked in the [main Preside repository](https://github.com/pixl8/Preside-CMS).

If you find yourself here, you're either a Preside contributor wanting to make changes to the core CKEditor files, or you're in the wrong place!
